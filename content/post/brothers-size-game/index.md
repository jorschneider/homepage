Experience a small slice of the road trip, dreams, and brotherhood at the heart of *The Brothers Size*. This browser-based microgame now opens with an in-universe briefing and selectable guiding principles, then stretches across six pivotal scenes and reactive roadside moments while you juggle **Bond**, police **Heat**, and shared **Spirit** for Ogun, Oshoosi, and Elegba.

## How to play

- **Pick a guiding principle** on the start screen to tweak the brothers' starting momentum.
- **Hit play on Otis Redding's "Try a Little Tenderness"** right from the intro overlay to loop the track while you guide the night.
- **Glance at the quick control panel** on the intro overlay—the keyboard shortcuts are now surfaced before you begin.
- **Click a choice** (or tap the glowing number badge) in each scene to respond to the latest twist in the brothers' journey.
- **Watch the meters** *and* the new live deltas to see how every decision nudges the trio.
- **Note the roadside flashes** that surface between scenes—quick vignettes that nudge stats before the next decision.
- **Read the memory ledger** at the bottom of the card to recap the actions you took.
- **Review the Dawn Reckoning recap** after the finale to see every choice, roadside flash, dream sign, and final stat line before you replay.
- **Reach dawn** and see how your stewardship shapes the final outcome. Press **Enter** to advance, **R** to restart, and experiment with different routes.

## What's new in this build

- A **Set the Driftline** start screen now lets you choose between balanced, guardian, or dreamer loadouts—each reshapes opening stats.
- The **journey timeline** stretches to six chapters, adding the outlet escape and blue-light pursuit with fresh choices and consequences.
- **Reactive roadside flashes** join the dream interludes, surfacing between scenes to nudge the meters based on how the run is going.
- A looping **"Try a Little Tenderness" soundtrack controller** cues the Otis Redding track (or your own upload) so the game always rides with music.
- A **Dawn Reckoning finale screen** summarizes every scene choice, roadside moment, dream sign, and the final stat state for easy debriefs.
- Keyboard shortcuts, selectable approaches, and richer log entries make replaying routes faster and clearer.

## Design notes

Building the mini-experience meant distilling the play's themes into tight, readable mechanics:

- The **Bond** meter rewards tenderness, honesty, and shared music—the threads that keep the brothers from drifting apart.
- **Heat** escalates when you push luck against the carceral system; calm choices keep the chase at bay.
- **Spirit** draws from dream logic and ritual. When it's low, exhaustion and hopelessness creep in.

Each ending echoes a possible future from McCraney's play, from the "Open Road" to the "Blue Lights" consequence of running out of time. Have fun experimenting, and let me know which version of the brothers' story resonates with you most.
